<h1>Hello {{target}}!</h1>
<!--
The template element is a place where we can hold markup and make
sure that it won't be rendered by the browser. This is quite useful if we
need to embed the templates of our application directly into the markup
of the page and let the template engine we're using to process them later.
In the current example, this means that if the Angular 2 DOM compiler
doesn't process the DOM tree, all we're going to see on the screen are the
h1, p elements and the ul element without any list items.

<ul>
<template ngFor var-todo [ngForOf]="todos">
<li>{{todo}}</li>
</template>
</ul>
