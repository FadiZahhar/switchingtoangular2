# switchingtoangular2

Crème de la crème of the book. simplified to well understand the core functionality of Angular2.

Angular2 is written with Type Script.
Typescript is a modern Microsoft OOP javascript, that work on both Ecmascript5 and Ecmascript6.

The Ecmascript 6 introduced classes Enumeration and Interfaces.
We will better understand these concepts by using these exercises one by one.

All exercises are commented and well orginized.
Each comment have a reference on a wiki for better explination.

Also a milestone have been set to this tutorial to be completed in a maximum of one Month.

In chapter 4 we went through the core building blocks of an Angular 2 application:
directives and components. We built a couple of sample components, which show
us the syntax to be used for the definition of these fundamental concepts. We also
described the life cycle of each directive and the core set of features the given directive
and component have. As the next step, we saw how we can enhance the performance
of our application by using the OnPush change detection strategy with immutable data.
